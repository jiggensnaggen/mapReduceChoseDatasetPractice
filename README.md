## Introduction
For this project, we will be exploring the statistics of US accidents in December of 2019. We will use this data set to tell us a story which can be important to improving future road safety.

## Data Source
Local - [US Accidents Data](./data/US_Accidents_Dec19)

Original - [https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)

Format - Excel CSV

Key Attributes - Start Time, End Time, State, County, City, Zip Code, Severity

Volume - 1.05 GB (3,000,000 unique entries)

Variety - Structured

Velocity - 0 because the data ends last year, only includes data from December 2019

Veracity - Most attributes are clean, but a few are messy. The trustworthiness of this dataset is a little questionable, without any way to verify its integrity.

Value - This could definitely hold some value to the city or state's government. They could use this data to see where more safety precautions are needed or maybe who needs more driving guidance/ training.
